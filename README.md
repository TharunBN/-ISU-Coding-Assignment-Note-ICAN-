        Warning!: This game may be flagged down for copyrights and I may be sued by Nintendo. If it ever happens, delete my browser history please...
        
 b) Purpose:
      I chose to make a recreation of smash bros becasue I actually enjoy playing the game. the game brings joy to me because I usaed to play it a lot with my friends and it really brough back some memories. I also wanted to do super smash bros because it is a fighting game and it would be really cool to create AI and fight against them and also make cool and unique characters with different abilites. It will test my coding and creative knowledge. 
      
 
 c) What I want to finish by June:
        I want to finish the game by june. I want to be able to fight the AI and be able to have a health system and multiple characters. I want to the project to be 95% done by the middle of June.
        
 d) I am using replit and pygame to code my project and to run my game.
